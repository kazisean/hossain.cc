## Linearization and Differentials
This is used to estimate values of a complex problem, for example the value of $\sqrt{3.92}$ without ever using a calculator. With the help of Linear Approximation we could get an answer very close to the actual value.

**Formula for Linear Approximation :**
$$f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)$$

**Steps to find the linear approximation :** {{< line_break >}}

**P**oint  **S**lope   **T**angent Line   **E**stimate  

```BibTeX
1. Find the point y by plugging into equation (as a whole number) or close to
2. Calculate the slope at that point by taking the derivative.
3. Write the equation of the tangent line in the point slope form.
4. Evaluate the tangent line to estimate nearby point
```

```BibTeX
1. Draw tangent lines along the curve of the given graph
2. Check if the slope is positve or negative 
3. If the slope is postive the graph is increasing on that interval vice versa
