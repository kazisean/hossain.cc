## Derivatives and Shapes of Graphs

Q : How to determine if a graph is increasing / decreasing given graph a of f'(x) {{< line_break >}}

```BibTeX
1. Draw tangent lines along the curve of the given graph
2. Check if the slope is positve or negative 
3. If the slope is postive the graph is increasing on that interval vice versa
