### Junk notes ideas
Discrete math is the love language of mathmatics. It is a way to speak and write math with extreme precision.

Most people find it difficult to edit their own writing; our brains know what we want to say
and trick us into believing that what we put onto paper is exactly what we intend.

• `Mathematical notation must be part of a complete sentence` \
**Bad** $3x + 5$ \
This is not a sentence! What about $3x + 5$? What is the write trying to say? \
**Good** When we substitute $x = -5/3$ into $3x + 5$ the result is 0

• `Do not assume the reader knows the context of your writing ` \
For example do not write "the function is equal to 4". Instead write the context on how : "When the fuction is evaluated at x = 10 the result is 4."

• `Do not write using pronouns`

• `Rewrite often` 
Never publish or consider a writing is finished on the first draft. Rewrite after which revise. Reread as many time as you can to edit to make it make sense to even a 5 years old.

LaTeX is most popular in writing discrete math papers.
