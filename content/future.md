### Information -- 
⦿ **Open Education**: Access to education and learning resources should be open and accessible for anyone to use, modify, and share; this includes textbooks, lecture notes, videos, and other learning materials. Funding should be directed towards the contributors, ensuring they are compensated for their work. How can we encourage institutions to foster a more open and collaborative environment, breaking down barriers so everyone worldwide can collaborate and access high-quality educational resources? 

⦿ **Scattered Resources**: Google is Good but outdated. There is a lot of valuable information on the web, but everything is scattered. Search engines should provide answers to questions within seconds so that I don't have to click 12 links, parsing through introductions to get what I am looking for. How can we solve the problem of scattered resources?


⦿ **Unbiased Reviews**: While shopping online, there is a hesitancy to read product reviews as to which one to trust. Decentralized product ranking and reviews should be a thing!
